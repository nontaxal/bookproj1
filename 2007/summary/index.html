     <p>epic book summary</p>
      
    <p>I really liked the book I Survived The Hindenburg Disaster, 1937 by Lauren Tarshis. I thought  the part where Hugo Ballard had to protect his friend who was a U.S. spy from a Nazi Soldier was very nice. He had to distract him so the spy could get away. The reason Hugo was in the cargo area (where he found out that the US spy was a spy) was because he was trying to get his sister's dog for her because she had malaria. There was an evil nazi man that caught him and asked why he was in the cargo area. He froze in place and didn't know what to say, but the spy still managed to get away and Hugo got his dog for his sister. I also liked the part where one of the ship members threw Hugo out the window to save him from the crash. </p><br>
<p>
The book started where Hugo and his family (mom, sister, dad) had to go to America from Kenya. They needed to go back to the U.S. for the great doctors for the Malaria that Gertie (sister) had gotten. She was getting high fevers, which is the reason they had to go back to America. They had seen a doctor before in Germany but he couldn't help them so they had to go to New York to see another doctor to get the doctor's treatment. This is why they took the Hindenburg in the first place, as it was by far the fastest way to get to America from Germany. During the flight Gertie wanted her dog so Hugo went into the cargo area to go and get the dog for Gertie. Even though Hugo went in the cargo hold he was scared because there was word that there was a spy on the Hindenburg that had a list of German spies living in America. There was a man named Colonel Joseph Kohl, who was rumored to be the Nazi who was searching for the spy. Hugo was getting the dog when he heard footsteps and he hid behind a box. It was Mr. Singer (a friend he made on the plane´s dad), and he got an envelope out of a box. That is when he realized that Mr. Singer was the spy! Then he heard more footsteps, and Colonel Kohl stepped out of the darkness. Hugo looked at Mr. Singer, and Mr Singer hid behind a crate and Hugo ran out. Hugo was stopped and warned for going into a forbidden place, while Mr. Singer managed to get away. And then the ship blew up. They heard a big explosion, and then they saw flames. They were all running around and panicking like idiots when they could’ve just jumped out the windows, but it was 1937 after all. He ended up being dumped out the window by Mr. Singer, and right after, Kohl put a gun to Mr. Singer’s head. I legit forgot what happened next and can’t find the page, but Mr. Singer did not get shot in the end.</p><br>

In the hospital, about 2 days later Hugo woke up and was surrounded by his family members. Bla bla bla stuff happened and they all lived happily ever after.
