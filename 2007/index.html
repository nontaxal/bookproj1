    <h2>Hugo Ballard Site</h2>
     <p>Hello, I am Hugo Ballard. I was born in 1926, and I am currently 97 years old.</p>
       <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I was on the Hindenburg Ship when it crashed in 1937. I survived this crash and went to the hospital for the next 2 months I was in the hospital recovering from the crash. Before all of this, we were in Kenya with my Dad because he was a Lion Hunter or something. Then my sister, Gerite got super bad malaria from a mosquito. So, we had to head to Germany to get the best children´s malaria doctor. When we met the doctor, they did nothing. So they said we should go to America as there is a malaria cure there. So, we took the Hindenburg to get to America as fast as possible, as we were running out of time. On the Hindenburg, Gertie started feeling a lot better but felt super lonely because our dog, Panya. So I went into the strictly forbidden cargo hold, to get the dog. But when I was there, I saw an American spy who was known to be on the ship, named Mr. Singer. A guy named Joseph Kohl was a Nazi who wanted to catch the spy, and nobody knew it was Singer until now. Singer spotted me, and then Kohl came into the cargo hold. Wanting to protect the spy, I jumped out from behind Panya´s cage, and obviously Kohl spotted me before Singer, so I was caught and he was safe. After telling Kohl that I was here for my sick sister because she wanted her dog, I was let of with a stern warning, and Kohl left. I had saved Mr. Singer, and we were 1 day from landing in America (or so we thought). When we were closing in for landing, the ship exploded. We all panicked, and when I passed out, Mr. Singer saved me by throwing me out the window. My fall didn´t hurt as much because one of the Hindenburg water tanks burst and softened the dirt I landed on. I was taken to the hospital with injuries, and spent 2 months in the hopsital.</p>
