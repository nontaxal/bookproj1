    <h2>Hello, I am Hugo Ballard.</h2>
     <h4>Here is some stuff about me</h4>
       <p>I was in a <strong>real</strong> I survived book! I am totally not a random person made up by Lauren Tarshis in 2009.</p>
       <h2>Other stuff about me</h2>
        <p> I was 11 when I totally survived the Hindenburg</p>
        <p>I found out a spy carrying a list of German spies in America and protected him from death!</p>
        <p>My sister got less sick on the Hindenburg</p>
        <p>Her dying wish was to die with her dog so I gave her the dog</p>
        <p>When I fell out of the Hindenburg, I started floating around in water and felt like I was back in Africa because one of the water tanks fell off the Hindenburg!</p>
        <p>And I am totally making this website and totally didnÂ´t die in 2001! This was totally not made 
            by a stupid kid for a book project...</p>
